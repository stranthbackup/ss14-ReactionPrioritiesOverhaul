      AME controller needs LV power and an HV wire to output to. Check the area with a crowbar if you aren't sure.

      You can put an AME anywhere if you can get the wires to it, though.
      3x3 grid of AME parts, multitool them to unpack. Be careful not to 'trap' anything.
      AME controller adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) to any point.
      With only 1 core (what a 3x3 grid will get you), don't turn it up above 2.
      The golden rule is 2 injection for every 1 core. You can go lower to save fuel.

      Don't forget to refuel it, it tends to stop at the worst possible time.
